## Movie Recommendation System

### Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. The system uses a dataset of movies and advanced machine learning algorithms to suggest similar or relevant movies.

### Features
- Recommends movies based on user input.
- Utilizes pre-processed data for efficient recommendations.
- Built with Python and designed for seamless interaction.
- Output of the project is included for user reference.

### Project Structure
The main components of the project are as follows:
- **`app/`**: Contains the core application logic.
- **`preprocessing/`**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing the data.
- **`movies.pkl`**: Serialized dataset for movie information.
- **`similarity.pkl`**: Pre-computed similarity matrix for recommendations.
- **`tmdb_5000_credits.csv`**: Credits dataset for movies.
- **`tmdb_5000_movies.csv`**: Detailed movie dataset.

### Installation
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Dataset
The project uses the **TMDb 5000 Movies Dataset**, which includes:
- Metadata about movies (title, genre, overview, etc.).
- Cast and crew information.

### Outputs
The project produces movie recommendations and has a visual output that showcases the recommendations. (Refer to the provided `output.png` for an example.)

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Flask**: For building the web interface (if applicable).

### Future Enhancements
- Integrate user-based collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better interaction.
- Include support for real-time movie data updates.
